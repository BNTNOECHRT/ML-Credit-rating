# ML_Credit_Rating
Objective :  Find similarities between individuals who share the same credit risk rating.

## Code:
- Work in progress. I plan on adding new code. I hope you can read the project at its current state. I did my best to make it still organized so you can see what I'm doing.

## Comments:
- Work in progress. I plan to explain in depth every method and tool I use. I believe anyone could copy-paste code and understand the libraries docs, and actually understanding what is happening and how things interact with each-others is the true skill. That's I truly hope to show with this project
